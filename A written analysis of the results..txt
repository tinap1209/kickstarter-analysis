## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Conclusion 1: The two conclusions drawn on the outcomes launch dates is that there was a slight peak in all events launched around the summer. May play directors worked with the launch date around the summer. Summertime is a very uplifting season for people as people are more relaxed and enjoy going out and watching plays. In contrast, fewer plays were scheduled to launch around the winter time.

Conclusion 2: All plays started saw a launch and an outcome (success or failure). None of the plays were cancelled. Which is very promising and shows hope for the future of theatre.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

This is a very interesting observation for me. I conclude that the lower the goal and the budget, the higher the chances for success. Which is very contradictory to the logic “Higher the risk Higher the income”. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Initially I had some difficulty with the data set, I eventually got familiar and want to work with the dataset more and more.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Number of people interested in donation.
More graphs based on category.
Popular plays based on countries.
